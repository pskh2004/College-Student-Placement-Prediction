# College Student Placement Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting college student placement outcomes based on various academic and extracurricular factors. It involves exploring a dataset of student attributes, preprocessing the data, training and evaluating several machine learning classification models, and visualizing their performance. The goal is to identify the most effective model for predicting student placement.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "College Student Placement Factors Dataset" available on Kaggle. It contains features such as IQ, previous semester results, CGPA, academic performance, internship experience, extracurricular score, communication skills, projects completed, and the target variable 'Placement'.

## Project Steps

The notebook guides through the following steps:

1.  **Data Loading and Initial Exploration:** Loading the dataset and performing initial checks.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming the data, including handling categorical features and removing irrelevant columns.
3.  **Correlation Analysis:** Visualizing the relationships between features and the target variable.
4.  **Model Selection and Training:** Choosing and training various classification models.
5.  **Model Evaluation and Best Model Selection:** Evaluating model performance using cross-validation and selecting the best model. This step also includes methods to identify potential overfitting.
6.  **Visualization of Results:** Generating plots and charts to visualize model performance metrics like accuracy, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.

## How to Run the Notebook

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) or download the notebook file.**
2.  **Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:**
    *   pandas
    *   scikit-learn
    *   matplotlib
    *   seaborn
    *   kagglehub (if downloading the dataset via KaggleHub)
    *   numba (a specific version might be required for pandas-profiling if used)
3.  **Download the dataset:** The notebook includes code to download the dataset using `kagglehub`. Alternatively, you can manually download the `college_student_placement_dataset.csv` file and place it in the appropriate directory.
4.  **Run the notebook cells sequentially.**

## Results

The notebook evaluates several models and identifies the best-performing one based on cross-validation accuracy. Visualizations are provided to help understand the performance of each model in detail.
